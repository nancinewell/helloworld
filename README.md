# Overview

This is a basic "Hello World" program. I am working to increase my skills and knowledge, preparing for the day when I am ready to join the workforce. As my current full time focus is educating children, I will often demonstrate my learning here as projects that will also benefit them.

This particular piece of software simply integrates Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Javascript.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
